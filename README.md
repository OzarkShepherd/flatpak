# Gramps Flatpak
These are the manifest and data files required to make a Gramps Flatpak

The flatpak is available on flathub at https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gramps_project.Gramps
The Gramps flatpak is currently 5.1.3 with the runtimes and dependencies to work independently regardless of the linux distribution.  There are also dependencies for some third party add-ons like Graphview and Network Chart.  Other add-ons might work, you can check if they are installable by using the Prerequisites Checker add-on.
